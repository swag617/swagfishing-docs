{% endhint %}

## ✨ What Makes SwagFishing Special?

SwagFishing transforms the vanilla Minecraft fishing experience into an engaging progression system with:

* **🐟 Custom Fish System** - Over 100+ unique fish across 5 rarity tiers
* **📖 Fish Codex** - Pokemon-style collection tracking and discovery system
* **🌳 Skill Tree** - Deep progression with unlockable passive abilities
* **🗿 Totems** - Powerful fishing buffs and enhancements
* **🏆 Tournaments** - Competitive fishing events with rewards
* **👥 Social Features** - Fish with friends for bonuses
* **🌍 Dynamic Events** - Server-wide fishing bonuses and special events
* **🔥 Nether Fishing** - Unique lava fishing mechanics
* **🐙 Boss Fish** - Epic multiplayer fishing battles
* **🌐 Web Editor** - Beautiful web interface for managing custom fish

## 🎮 Core Philosophy

### **Codex = Cosmetic Collection**
The Fish Codex is purely for **showing off** your achievements. Catching rare fish is rewarding, but it doesn't give gameplay advantages. This respects both casual collectors and competitive players.

### **Skills = Gameplay Power**
Passive buffs come from the **Skill Tree**, which is unlocked through **grinding and player choice**. This ensures that:
* Power comes from effort, not luck
* Players can customize their fishing style
* Progression is always guaranteed

### **No Pay-to-Win, No RNG Walls**
Everyone has access to the same fishing opportunities. Success comes from:
* Time invested (XP and levels)
* Strategic skill choices
* Knowledge of fish spawns and conditions
