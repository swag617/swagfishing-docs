# 🐟 Fishing System

SwagFishing completely replaces Minecraft's vanilla fishing with a rich, progression-based system featuring over 100 unique fish across 5 rarity tiers.

## How Fishing Works

### Basic Mechanics

1. **Equip a fishing rod** (any rod works)
2. **Cast your line** into water
3. **Wait for a bite** (normal fishing mechanics)
4. **Reel in** when you get a bite
5. **Receive a custom fish** (85% chance) or vanilla loot (15%)

{% hint style="info" %}
The chance to catch custom fish vs vanilla loot is configurable in `config.yml`
{% endhint %}

### What Determines Fish Spawns?

When you catch a fish, SwagFishing checks multiple conditions:

#### 🌍 Location Requirements

**Biome**
Fish can be restricted to specific biomes:
* Ocean fish → Ocean, Deep Ocean, Cold Ocean, etc.
* River fish → River, Frozen River
* Swamp fish → Swamp, Mangrove Swamp
* Jungle fish → Jungle, Bamboo Jungle

**Y-Level (Altitude)**
Some fish only spawn at certain heights:
* Deep ocean fish → Y 0-40
* Surface fish → Y 60-80
* Mountain lake fish → Y 100+

**World**
Fish can be limited to specific worlds:
* Overworld only
* Nether only (future feature)
* End only

#### ⏰ Time Requirements

Fish can be active only during specific times:

| Time | In-Game Time | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **DAWN** | 0 - 2000 ticks | Sunrise period |
| **DAY** | 2000 - 10000 ticks | Daytime |
| **DUSK** | 10000 - 12000 ticks | Sunset period |
| **NIGHT** | 12000+ ticks | Nighttime |
| **ANY** | All times | No restriction |

**Example:** Emerald Trout only spawns at DAWN

#### ☁️ Weather Requirements

Fish can require specific weather:

| Weather | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **CLEAR** | No rain or thunder |
| **RAIN** | Raining |
| **THUNDER** | Thunderstorm |
| **ANY** | Any weather |

**Example:** Jungle Piranha is more active during RAIN

#### 🌊 Depth Requirements (Future)

Fish will spawn based on water depth:
* **Shallow (< 3 blocks)** - Common fish only
* **Medium (3-10 blocks)** - Common + Uncommon
* **Deep (10+ blocks)** - All rarities

## Rarity System

Fish come in 5 rarity tiers, each with increasing rewards:

### ⚪ Quartz (Common)
* **Weight:** High (80-100)
* **Rewards:** 5-6 XP, 2 Essence, $8-15
* **Examples:** Common Cod, River Bass, Swamp Catfish

### 💚 Emerald (Uncommon)
* **Weight:** Medium (40-50)
* **Rewards:** 15-20 XP, 5-6 Essence, $50-70
* **Examples:** Emerald Trout, Ocean Guardian, Jungle Piranha

### 💙 Sapphire (Rare)
* **Weight:** Low (18-25)
* **Rewards:** 35-45 XP, 12-18 Essence, $150-200
* **Examples:** Sapphire Marlin, Frozen Pike, Midnight Eel

### ❤️ Ruby (Very Rare)
* **Weight:** Very Low (8-10)
* **Rewards:** 75-100 XP, 30-40 Essence, $400-500
* **Broadcasts:** Server announcement when caught!
* **Examples:** Ruby Tuna, Crimson Shark

### 💜 Amethyst (Mythical)
* **Weight:** Extremely Low (2-3)
* **Rewards:** 250-300 XP, 100-125 Essence, $1000-1500
* **Broadcasts:** Epic server announcement!
* **Examples:** Amethyst Leviathan, Celestial Koi

## Weighted Spawning

Fish don't spawn with equal probability. The system uses a weighted random selection:

### How It Works

1. **Filter eligible fish** based on location, time, weather
2. **Calculate total weight** from all eligible fish
3. **Apply rarity multipliers** from config
4. **Random selection** weighted by fish rarity + individual weight

### Example Scenario

You're fishing in the **Ocean** during **Day** with **Clear** weather:

**Eligible Fish:**
* Common Cod (weight: 100, rarity: QUARTZ)
* Ocean Guardian (weight: 40, rarity: EMERALD)  
* Sapphire Marlin (weight: 25, rarity: SAPPHIRE)

**Rarity Weights** (from config):
* QUARTZ: 1.0
* EMERALD: 0.5
* SAPPHIRE: 0.25

**Effective Weights:**
* Common Cod: 100 × 1.0 = 100
* Ocean Guardian: 40 × 0.5 = 20
* Sapphire Marlin: 25 × 0.25 = 6.25

**Chances:**
* Common Cod: ~79%
* Ocean Guardian: ~16%
* Sapphire Marlin: ~5%

## Fish Rewards

## Catch Messages

```

**Examples:**
* `SwagFish » You caught a Common Cod!` (white)

### Legendary Broadcasts

When someone catches a **Ruby** or **Amethyst** fish, the entire server sees:

```

**Amethyst Example:**
```

```

{% endhint %}
